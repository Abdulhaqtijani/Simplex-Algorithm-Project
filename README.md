A command-line C++ implementation of the Simplex method for solving linear programming problems. The program takes input matrices for constraints, the objective function, and applies pivot operations to determine the optimal solution. Ideal for students and professionals working on operations research and optimization problems.

How to Use
1️⃣ Compile with g++ simplex.cpp -o simplex
2️⃣ Run ./simplex and input your LP problem
3️⃣ Get the optimal solution and objective function value# Simplex-Algorithm-Project
